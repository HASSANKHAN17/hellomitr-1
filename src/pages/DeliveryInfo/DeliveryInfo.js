            How the delivery charge is calculated for multiple units and some products.
            </p>
            <p className="l2">
            The shipping charge is based on the weight of the product. For multiple products ordered from the same category the program adds up the weight of all the units ordered and charges a single delivery fee.
            </p>

            <p className="l2">
            Thus, a customer who orders three books weighing 200gms, 250gms and 400gms is charged a single delivery fee of a consignment weighing more than 500gms but less than one kg. The customer is not charged for three different consignments weighing less than 500gms each. Thus the customer will pay a delivery fee of Rs 99 for ordering the three books as a single order instead of Rs 142 if he orders them separately. Order above â‚¹ 999 is free to deliver.
            </p>

            <p className="l2">
            However, the delivery fee is calculated separately when a customer orders different products. Thus, if a customer orders a Shirts he will pay separate delivery charges for each product. This is because the products are being sourced and shipped from different cities.
            </p>

            <p className="l2">
            The minimum weight taken into account is 250gms (only for documents) for domestic shipments.
            </p>

            <p className="l2">
            The weight of the product has been built in into the delivery charge of each product. This will automatically be added to the product cost at the payment stage. The delivery cost of a consignment weighing 3 Kg to be shipped within India will be = INR 299.
            </p>

            <p className="l2">
            The delivery charge is arrived at by multiplying the weight of the product with the slab rate.
            </p>
